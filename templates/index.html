    <h1>CMS Masterclass</h1>

    <p>
      The purpose of this masterclass is to allow you to identify for yourself 
      some interesting particle physics interactions or "events".
      These events have been seen using an 
      experiment called
      <a href="https://cms.cern/" target="_blank"> CMS.</a>
      This experiment runs at the
      <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider">LHC</a>
      (Large Hadron Collider) at <a href="https://home.cern/" target="_blank">CERN</a>, the
      European Organization for Nuclear Research,
      near Geneva, Switzerland. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular you will examine events analyzed as part of the discovery of the
      <a href="https://home.cern/science/physics/higgs-boson/what" target="_blank">Higgs Boson</a>.
      The Higgs Boson was discovered by the CMS and ATLAS experiments. The announcement of this
      discovery was 4 July 2012.
